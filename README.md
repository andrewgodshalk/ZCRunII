# ZCRunII

A number of programs used for the analysis of data collected by the [Compact Muon Solenoid experiment][CMS] at the [LHC][LHC]. These analyses are used to study the cross section of a Z boson created in association with a c-quark jet.

These programs run on [ROOT][ROOT] ntuples created from CMS MINIAOD data by an [ntupler][Ntupler] adapted from [CMS VHbb group][VHbb].

Project created from template by [Hiltmon][Simple C++ Project Structure].
